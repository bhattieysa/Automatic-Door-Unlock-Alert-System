Automatic Door Unlock &amp; Alerts System With The Help Of Raspberry Pi
# working Details
The Automatic Door Unlock and Alert System (ADUAS) is a cutting-edge security technology specifically developed for home use. The system primarily uses a Raspberry Pi microcontroller to coordinate a sophisticated authentication and threat detection process. The first level of security is achieved by using eye blink detection, which accurately distinguishes between a real person and a photograph. This helps to reduce the possibility of someone using static photos to deceive the system. After confirming the person's live presence, the system uses facial recognition technology to determine if the individual is a registered member of the family. Once the individual is identified, the door unlocks smoothly, ensuring a user-friendly experience while maintaining security. On the other hand, if the face does not correspond to any recognised family member, the system triggers an alarm to indicate the presence of an unfamiliar individual. The system has improved its security measures by integrating object detection algorithms that can accurately identify possible weapons. This functionality is essential for anticipating security breaches and guaranteeing a secure environment. The incorporation of these technologies into the tiny and efficient Raspberry Pi platform showcases the system's adaptability and capacity for extensive acceptance in contemporary households. This summary summarises the core of the project, emphasising its creative utilisation of technology to offer a secure and convenient access control system.![image](https://github.com/bhattieysa/Automatic-Door-Unlock-Alert-System/assets/89656526/b2cc08ea-0345-412f-b50d-45a5a8b738ee)
